        <b>Context</b>
    </h4>
     <p>
         This experiment is concerned with the way nations involved in international fisheries make collective decisions.<br>
         You will play as a representative of a Bluefin tuna fishing nation involved in the
         <b>International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)</b><br>
         TThe aim of this institution is to ensure sustainable exploitation of the stock, targeting a biomass level at the <b>maximum sustainable yield (MSY)</b>.<br>
         You will be assigned to a fishing nation which has the same characteristics in term of fishing efficiency and capacity as others.<br>
         You will harvest the same stock of resource, the Bluefin tuna stock, with other nations controlled by a manager, a player,
         but you don't know who are these players and how they plan their fishing activity.<br>
         As one of the 3 participants of your group, you will decide annually (each turn represents one year in this experiment),
         for an unknown number of periods, the harvest level of your national fishing fleet.

        <b>Resource dynamic and Profit</b>
    </h4>
     <p>
         The resource supports a dynamic which is known from players and shown through the <b>''Growth function'' </b>.<br>
         This function gives you the growth potential of any stock level you left behind you.<br> The maximum growth is reached for a resource around <b>{{ Constants.Bmsy }}
         (10<sup>4</sup> tons)</b>.<br>
         Each year, each round, you will select the level of catch allowable for your fishing industry.<br>
         You can select this catch from <b>{{ Constants.min_catch }} to {{ Constants.max_catch }} (10<sup>4</sup> tons) </b>, so each a maximum of
         <b>{{ Constants.max_total_catch }} (10<sup>4</sup> tons)</b> can be harvested. <br>
         The profit expected from this catch is linked to the state of the resource and can be deduced from the <b>''Profit
         functions''</b>.<br>
         In view of this relationship, at the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY, the maximum harvest allowing a constant resource size)
         which represent a catch of <b>{{ Constants.Ymsy }} (10<sup>4</sup> tons) per year </b>, the total profit shared by all nations will be <b> 23.1 10<sup>7</sup> € each </b>.
     </p>

       <b> Treatments </b>
    </h4>
     <p>
         Depending on the treatment in which you are assiociated with, a critical level of biomass exists which determine an additional cost of <b> {{ Constants.tFixedCost }} 10<sup>7</sup> € </b>
         if the threshold <b>Blim</b> is exceeded.<br>
         This threshold represents a sudden shift in the management regime to mimic the socio-economic situation of the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery.<br>
         The scientific committee of the <b>ICCAT</b> has an uncertain or a perfect (depending on the treatment) method to estimate the critical level of biomass.<br>
         This information is shared in the form of an accurate value of <b>Blim</b> or a range of values <b>[Blim,min:Bmin,max]</b>.
