       <b>Your results from the test: </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        First of all, if at the beginning of the year the biomass is at a level of 25 (10<sup>4</sup> t), could you indicate how many
        (10<sup>4</sup> t) the stock will regenerate for the next year ?<br>
        <b>{{ growthRes }} {{ g }}</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, still with a stock of 25 10<sup>4</sup> t if the 3 coalitions decide to harvest 9 10<sup>4</sup> t (3 10<sup>4</sup> t each), could you indicate how many
        profit profit in 10<sup>7</sup> € the harvest will generate this year?<br>
        <b>{{ profitRes }} {{ p }}</b>

    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, still with a stock of 25 10<sup>4</sup> t and a total harvest of 9 10<sup>4</sup> t by the 3 coalitions (3 10<sup>4</sup> t each), could you indicate how many
        biomass in 10<sup>7</sup> € will be available for the next year?<br>
        <b>{{ biomassRes }} {{ b }}</b>
