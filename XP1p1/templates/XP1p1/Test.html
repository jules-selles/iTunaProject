        Before beginning the session, We want to make sure you understand the dynamic process which drive the resource level.

    <p>
        First of all, if at the beginning of the year the biomass is at a level of {{ Constants.b_test }} UVS, could you indicate how many
        UVS the stock will regenerate for the next year ?

        {% formfield player.growthTest with label="Resource growth in UVS for the year" %}

    </p>

    <p>
        Then, still with a stock of {{ Constants.b_test }} UVS if the {{ Constants.players_per_group }} coalitions decide to harvest
        {{ Constants.c_test }} UVS ({{ Constants.c_ind_test }} UVS each), could you indicate how many
        profit profit in UVM the harvest will generate this year?

        {% formfield player.profitTest with label="Total profit in UVM for the year" %}

    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, still with a stock of {{ Constants.b_test }} UVS and a total harvest of {{ Constants.c_test }} UVS by
        the  {{ Constants.players_per_group }} coalitions ({{ Constants.c_ind_test }} UVS each), could you indicate how many
        biomass in UVM will be available for the next year?

        {% formfield player.biomassTest with label="Biomass available in UVS fot the next year" %}
