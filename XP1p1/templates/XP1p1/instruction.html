        <b>Experimental rules</b>

        <b>Basic rules</b>
    </h4>

    <p align ="center">
        You will be paid proportionately to your profit during the experiment at a rate of :<br>
        <b> 1 (10<sup>7</sup> € in the experiement) = 0.05 € </b>
    </p>

    <p>
     <b> Remember some rules during the experiment:</b>
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Talking is not permitted.</li>
        <li>You are not permitted to operate other software such as email or internet during the experiment.</li>
        <li>You may ask questions to the instructor during the experiment if you have any problems. But keep in mind that you must make decisions and develop strategies by yourself.</li>
      </ul>

    <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
        <b>Context</b>
    </h4>
     <p>
         This experiment is concerned with the way stakeholders of international fisheries make collective decisions.<br>
         You will play as a representative and the manager of a Bluefin tuna fishing coalition of nations industry involved in the
         <b>International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)</b>.<br>
         You will be assigned to a fishing coalition which has the same characteristics in term of fishing efficiency and capacity as others.<br>
         You will harvest the same stock of resource, the Bluefin tuna stock, with others nations controlled by a manager, a player, but you
         don't know who are these players and how they plan their fishing activity.<br>
         The game isn't not in a sequential nature like, in other words each year, each round you take a decision in
         term of abstraction from the resource, your decision more the others players decision will be felt in the next
         round.
     </p>
    <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
        <b>Resource dynamic and Profit</b>
    </h4>
     <p>
         The resource supports a dynamic which is known from players and shown through the <b>''Growth function'' </b> given by .<br>
         This function gives you the growth potential of any stock level you left behind you.<br> The maximum growth is reached for a resource of {{ Constants.Bmsy }}
         (10<sup>7</sup> tones).<br>
         Each year, each round, you will select the level of catch allowable for your fishing industry.<br>
         You can select this catch from <b>{{ Constants.min_catch }} to {{ Constants.max_catch }} (10<sup>4</sup> tones) </b>, so each a maximum of
         {{ Constants.max_total_catch }} (10<sup>4</sup> tones) can be harvested. <br>
         The profit expected from this catch is linked to the state of the resource and can be deduced from the <b>''Profit
         functions''</b>.<br>
         In view of this relationship, at the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY, the maximum harvest allowing a constant resource size)
         which represent a catch of <b>{{ Constants.Ymsy }} (10<sup>4</sup> tones) per year </b>, the total profit shared by all nations will be <b>25.1 (10<sup>7</sup> €)</b>.
     </p>
    <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
       <b> Treatments </b>
    </h4>
     <p>
         Depending on the treatment in which you are assiociated with, a critical level of biomass exists which determine an additional cost
         if the threshold <b>Blim</b> is exceeded.<br>
         This threshold represents a sudden shift in the management regime to mimic the socio-economic situation of the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery.<br>
         The scientific committee of the ICCAT has an uncertain or a perfect (depending on the treatment) method to estimate the critical level of biomass.<br>
         This information is shared in the form of an accurate value of <b>Blim</b> or a range of values <b>[Blim,min:Bmin,max]</b>.
     </p>
    <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">
        <b>Phases</b>
    </h4>
     <p>
         Finally, during the experiment you will play 2 phases of this game with a different uncertainty on the resource state.<br>
         The accurate information about the resource size Bt will be deteriorate and you will have access only to the
         range of values <b>[Bmin,t;Bmax,t]</b> each year.
     </p>

    <p align="center">  <b>Good luck!</b> </p>
