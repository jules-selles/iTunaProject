       <br>Your results from the test: </br>
    </p>

    <p>
        First of all, if at the beginning of the year the biomass is at a level of 25 UVS, could you indicate how many
        UVS the stock will regenerate for the next year ?<br>
        <b>{{ growthRes }} </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, still with a stock of 25 UVS if the 3 coalitions decide to harvest 9 UVS (3UVS each), could you indicate how many
        profit profit in UVM the harvest will generate this year?<br>
        <b>{{ profitRes }} </b>

    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, still with a stock of 25 UVS and a total harvest of 9 UVS by the 3 coalitions (3UVS each), could you indicate how many
        biomass in UVM will be available for the next year?<br>
        <b>{{ biomassRes }} </b>

    </p>
